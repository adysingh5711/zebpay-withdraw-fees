# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the crypto price tracker's API connection validation logic. The current implementation incorrectly reports "Token BTC not found on ZebPay" during connection validation, causing the application to fail startup even though BTC is available and the API is working correctly. This fix will improve the robustness of the API validation process and ensure reliable application startup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator running the crypto price tracker, I want the API connection validation to work reliably, so that the application starts successfully when the ZebPay API is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the API connection validation SHALL succeed if ZebPay API is accessible
2. WHEN BTC token is available on ZebPay THEN the validation SHALL not report "Token BTC not found"
3. IF the validation token is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL try alternative validation methods
4. WHEN API validation succeeds THEN the application SHALL proceed with normal operation
5. WHEN API validation fails due to actual connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL report accurate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the crypto tracker, I want improved error handling in API validation, so that I can distinguish between actual API failures and temporary token availability issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API returns 404 for a token THEN the system SHALL distinguish between "token not found" and "API endpoint not found"
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the error messages SHALL clearly indicate the root cause
3. IF multiple validation attempts are needed THEN the system SHALL try different tokens or validation approaches
4. WHEN logging validation errors THEN the system SHALL include sufficient context for debugging
5. WHEN validation succeeds after retries THEN the system SHALL log the successful validation method

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the crypto tracker, I want the application to be more resilient to temporary API issues, so that minor API hiccups don't prevent the application from running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN primary validation token fails THEN the system SHALL attempt validation with alternative tokens
2. WHEN API responses are inconsistent THEN the system SHALL implement more robust validation logic
3. IF validation takes multiple attempts THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
4. WHEN validation eventually succeeds THEN the application SHALL continue normal operation
5. WHEN all validation attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on next steps
